I'm building a grocery app with Flutter!  This will be a handy tool to ditch the paper shopping lists and streamline those grocery runs. Here's the basic idea:

Users can add items to their list, and maybe even categorize them for easy browsing (dairy, produce, pantry staples).
Sharing the list with others would be a great feature, for instance, for couples or roommates to coordinate.
Ideally, the app would integrate with local stores so users can browse products and even see current prices.
Finally, allowing users to order groceries for delivery or pickup would be the ultimate time-saver!
